                I'm doing a (free) operating system
                (just a hobby, won't be big and
                professional like gnu) for 386(486)
                AT clones. This has been brewing
                since april, and is starting to get
                ready. I'd like any feedback on things
                people like/dislike in minix, as my OS
                resembles it somewhat (same physical
                layout of the file-system (due to
                practical reasons) among other things).

                I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
